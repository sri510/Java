/*
Class Batter is given to you. Add below details to the class

 

 1. Instance variables:

 name: private -String,

 runs: private-int,

 matches: private-int,

 batting_avg: private-float.

 

 

2.  Method batterDetails() : public void

Create a method name called batterDetails() that accepts name, runs, matches.

Method name: batterDetails

Return type: void

 

 

 



 3. Create below public methods,

 

 Method name: computeBattingAverage

 Return type: void

 

 This method should print the batting average of the batter by dividing run with matches.

 Input: 

Name: "Sachin"

Runs: 18000

Matches: 463



 Output:

 Name: Sachin

 Batting_Avg: 38.87689

 

 Note: a. If runs or matches values are negative print 'Error'.

 b. If runs are greater than 0 when matches are 0 print 'Error'.

 

 Method name: getStatistics

 Return type: void

 

 This method should print the details of the batter.

 Input: 

Name: "Sachin"

Runs: 18000

Matches: 463



 Output:

 Name: Sachin

 Runs: 18000

 Matches: 463

 

 Note: a. If runs or matches values are negative print 'Error'.

 b. If runs are greater than 0 when matches are 0 print 'Error'.

 

 Given an ELC(Executable Logic class) class for Testing that contains main method. Use this class to test your code.
