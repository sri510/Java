/*
Create a class BankAccount with instance variables balance and interestRate. Implement an instance block that initializes

 the instance variable interestRate to 0.01. Implement a parameterized constructor that sets the instance variable balance.

 Implement an instance method deposit(amount) that adds amount to the balance. Implement another instance method withdraw(amount)

 that subtracts amount from the balance. Implement an instance method calculateInterest() that returns

 the interest earned on the balance based on the interestRate. Create a BankAccount object with a balance of 1000 and call the

 deposit(), withdraw(), and calculateInterest() methods on it.

Expected output:

Balance amount after deposit of 2500.0 rupees in the bank account is = 3500.0

Balance amount after withdraw of 387.0 rupees from the bank account is = 3113.0

Interest earned on balance amount is = 31.13
