/*
Build a ClassroomBookingSystem class to reserve classrooms for lectures.

1.Create a class Room
Instance variable:-
String roomNumber,private
boolean isReserved,private

Create a parameterise constructor using roomNumber and initialise isResrved with default value.

Create an instance method reserveRoom() 
if room is reserved then pirnt "Room " + roomNumber + " has been reserved."
other wise room not booked

create a method isReserved()
Access Modifier:-
public 
Return type:-
boolean

2. Create a class Classroom and inherite Room class here.
Create parameterise constructor of class Classroom to initialise parent class 
constructor.

create an instance method  displayInfo() to print the class-room Details

3. Create a class LectureRoom and inherite Room class here.   
Create parameterise constructor of class Classroom to initialise parent class 
constructor.

create an instance method  displayInfo() to print the lacture-room Details

4.Create a class ClassroomBookingSystem which contains main method to test your code.
//Create an object of class Classroom and LectureRoom
and call their methods.

Room 101 has been reserved.
Room 201 has been reserved.
Classroom Number: 101
Lecture Room Number: 201
Is classroom1 reserved? true
Is lectureRoom1 reserved? true.
