/*
Develop a TicketBookingSystem class for booking tickets for various modes of transportation.

1.Create a class Ticket

Instance variable:-

String source,private

String destination,private

int price,private

Create a parameteries constructor to initialise the instance variable.

Create an instance method displayTicketDetails() to print the above variable's.

2.Create a class TrainTicket inherite Ticket class here.

Instance Variable:-

String trainNumber,private

Create a perameterise constructor to initialise the instance variable.

Also use super to intialise the parent class variable.

Override the instance method which is present in Ticket class displayTicketDetails() to print the above variable and use super to print the parent class details.

3.Create a class BusTicket inherite Ticket class here.

Instance variable:-

String busCompany,private

Create a perameterise constructor to initialise the instance variable.

Also use super to intialise the parent class variable.

Override the instance method which is present in Ticket class  displayTicketDetails() to print the above variable and use super to print the parent class details.

4.Create a class FlightTicket inherite Ticket class here.

Instance variable:-

String flightNumber,private

Create a perameterise constructor to initialise the instance variable.

Also use super to intialise the parent class variable.

Override the instance method which is present in Ticket class  displayTicketDetails() to print the above variable and use super to print the parent class details.

5.Create an ELC class TicketBookingSystem which contains main method to test your code.

//Create object's for class TrainTicket,BusTicket and FlightTicket

//call the methods those are present in above classes.

Output:-

Train Ticket Details:

Source: City A
