Online Shopping System
You are tasked with implementing an online shopping system that allows customers to add products to their shopping carts and perform checkouts. You need to create three classes: Product, ShoppingCart, and Customer.

Product Class
Create a Product class that represents a product available for purchase. The class should have the following attributes and methods:

Attributes:

name (private): A string representing the name of the product.
price (private): A double representing the price of the product.
Methods:

Product(String name, double price): Constructor that initializes the name and price attributes.
getName(): Returns the name of the product.
getPrice(): Returns the price of the product.
ShoppingCart Class
Create a ShoppingCart class that represents a customer's shopping cart. The class should have the following attributes and methods:

Attributes:

itemCount (private): An integer representing the number of items in the cart.
totalAmount (private): A double representing the total amount of the items in the cart.
products (private): An array of Product objects representing the products in the cart.
Methods:

ShoppingCart(): Constructor that initializes the itemCount to 0, totalAmount to 0, and creates an array of Product objects with a maximum capacity of 10.
addProduct(Product product): Adds a product to the cart. If the cart is not full, updates the products array and increments itemCount and totalAmount.
getTotalAmount(): Returns the total amount of the items in the cart.
Customer Class
Create a Customer class that represents a customer using the online shopping system. The class should have the following attributes and methods:

Attributes:

name (private): A string representing the name of the customer.
cart (private): A ShoppingCart object representing the customer's shopping cart.
Methods:

Customer(String name): Constructor that initializes the name and creates a new ShoppingCart object for the customer.
addToCart(Product product): Adds a product to the customer's shopping cart.
checkout(): Performs a checkout by displaying the customer's name and the total amount of their shopping cart.
OnlineShoppingSystem Class
Create an OnlineShoppingSystem class with a main method to simulate the online shopping scenario. In the main method:

Create three Product objects with different names and prices.
Create two Customer objects with different names.
Have each customer add products to their shopping carts.
Have each customer perform a checkout.
Note: Ensure that the program demonstrates encapsulation by accessing the attributes of the classes only through their public methods.

After implementing the classes and main method, run the program to see the interactions between customers, products, and shopping carts in an online shopping system.

        Product iPhone = new Product("iPhone ", 75000);
        Product Macbook = new Product("Macbook ", 120000);

        Customer customer1 = new Customer("Sripriya");
        customer1.addToCart(Laptop);
        customer1.addToCart(iPhone);
        customer1.checkout();
