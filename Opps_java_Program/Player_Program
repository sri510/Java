/*
In OOP if we write everything in a single class then it is not an object oriented approach even we are creating object, It enhances tight coupling (dependency is very high).
if we separate our classes with BLC and ELC approach then reusability of our BLC classes would be possible from same package and even from different package.

Player.java
------------
package com.sri.blc_elc;

//BLC
public class Player 
{
  int playerId;
  String playerName;
  double playerPrice;
  
  public void acceptPlayerData(int id, String name, double price)
  {
	  playerId = id;
	  playerName = name;
	  playerPrice = price;
  }
  
  public void playerInformation()
  {
	  System.out.println("Player Id is :"+playerId);
	  System.out.println("Player Name is :"+playerName);
	  System.out.println("Player Price is :"+playerPrice);
  }
  
}

Main.java
----------
package com.sri.blc_elc;

//ELC
public class Main 
{
	public static void main(String[] args) 
	{
		Player rohit = new Player();
		rohit.acceptPlayerData(45, "Rohit Sharma", 12000.00);
		rohit.playerInformation();
		
	}

}


Virat.java
----------
package com.sri.blc_elc;

public class Virat {

	public static void main(String[] args) 
	{
		Player virat = new Player();
		virat.acceptPlayerData(18, "Virat Kohli", 12500.00);
		virat.playerInformation();
	}

}



In order to re-use this Player class (BLC) class, we have another class called Dhoni available in another package

Dhoni.java
-----------
package com.sri.re_use;

import com.ravi.blc_elc.Player;

public class Dhoni {

	public static void main(String[] args) 
	{
		Player dhoni = new Player();
		dhoni.acceptPlayerData(7, "MSD", 15890.90);
		dhoni.playerInformation();
	}

}
