/*
Build a TheaterBookingSystem class to reserve seats for movies or events.

1.Create a class Seat
Instance variable:-
String SeatNumber,private
boolean isReserved,private

Create a parameterise constructor using seatNumber and initialise isResrved with default value.

Create an instance method reserveSeat() 
if seat is reserved then pirnt "Seat " + seatNumber + " has been reserved."
other wise seat not booked

create a method isReserved()
Access Modifier:-
public 
Return type:-
boolean

2.Create a class RegularSeat and inherite Seat class here.
Create parameterise constructor of class RegularSeat to initialise parent class constructor.

3.Create a class VIPSeat and inherite Seat class here.
Create parameterise constructor of class RegularSeat to initialise parent class constructor.

4.Create a class TheaterBookingSystem which contains main method to test your code
//Create an object of class RegularSeat and VIPSeat to intialise the constructors
//and call their method's.

 Output:-
Seat A1 has been reserved.
Seat VIP1 has been reserved.
Is regularSeat1 reserved? true
Is vipSeat1 reserved? true.
